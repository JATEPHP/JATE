## HOW DOES IT TO WORK?
There are 3 main sections.
 - the libraries that are contained in dist/jate.
 - the pages that are contained in bundles divided into MVC.
 - the modules that you can create that are contained in modules.

You start by creating an html interface in _bundles/views_.<br>
Then you have to continue creating a model that ignetter√† tags in the view in _bundles/models_.<br>
Creates a class for each page that you want to have in your app in _bundles/controller_.<br>
Each time you add a page, remember to connect it with the class in config/router.json file.<br>
