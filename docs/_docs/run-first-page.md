**Warning:** Make sure you have enabled **.htaccess** files on your web server before using JATE.
{: .notice--warning}

Once you have downloaded JATE you come up with a folder in a similar situation to `/phpRoot/projectHero/.../JATE`, the path may change depending on the method you used to download JATE.

**Warning:** If you have **not used the cli** to download the project the next step is to enter in `JATE/examples/01essentials`, copy the contents of the folder and paste it into`/phpRoot/projectHero`. By doing this you have created the minimum necessary to run JATE.
{: .notice--warning}

**Success:** Now you can access the browser through your localhost such as `http://localhost/projectHero/` and see the page.
