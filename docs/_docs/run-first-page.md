Once you have downloaded JATE you come up with a folder in a similar situation to `/phpRoot/projectHero/.../JATE`, the path may change depending on the method you used to download JATE.

If you have __not used the cli__ to download the project the next step is to enter in `JATE/examples/01essentials`, copy the contents of the folder and paste it into` /phpRoot/projectHero`. By doing this you have created the minimum necessary to run JATE.

Now you can access the browser through your localhost such as `http://localhost/projectHero/` and see the page.
